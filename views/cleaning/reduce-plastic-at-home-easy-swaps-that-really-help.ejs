                                    especially in kitchens, bathrooms, and storage areas.

                                    Plastic waste takes a long time to break down, and a large amount of it ends up in
                                    landfills and oceans. When homes use too many disposable plastic items, it increases
                                    trash, cleaning work, and unnecessary spending.
                                </p>

                                    Reducing plastic also improves home organization. Fewer plastic bottles, wrappers,
                                    and
                                    containers means less clutter in cabinets and less waste in bins. A home that
                                    focuses
                                    on eco-friendly habits often feels cleaner and more structured.

                                    Plastic wrap is used once and thrown away, which creates waste every day. Instead of

                                    Many people try to reduce plastic quickly by buying too many eco-friendly products

                                    once. This can create extra spending and new clutter. The best approach is to switch

                                    mixing waste incorrectly can reduce recycling effectiveness. It’s better to focus on
