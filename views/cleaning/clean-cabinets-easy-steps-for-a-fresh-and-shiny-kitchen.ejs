                                    especially around handles and cooking areas.

                                </h2>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                                    Cabinets sit close to cooking, which means they get exposed to steam, grease, and
                                    heat
                                    almost every day. Even when you clean your kitchen regularly, cabinet surfaces still
                                    collect buildup because oils in the air stick to them.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                                    Another reason is frequent touching. Hands leave fingerprints, especially on glossy
                                    or
                                    dark cabinets. Around the stove area, grease particles create a sticky layer that
                                    traps
                                    dust and makes cleaning harder if ignored for too long.

                                    Dirt First</h3>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                                    Before using water or any cleaner, wipe cabinets with a dry microfiber cloth. This
                                    removes loose dust and prevents muddy stains from forming when the surface gets wet.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                                    Focus on the top edges of cabinets because they collect dust that you may not notice

                                    first. Cleaning dry dirt first makes the full process faster and smoother.

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                                    Warm water mixed with mild dish soap works well for most cabinet surfaces. Dip your
                                    cloth into the mixture, wring it out properly, and wipe the cabinet gently.
                                </p>

                                    Grease is common around stove-side cabinets. It creates a sticky layer that needs a

                                    require a stronger gentle solution.
                                </p>

                                    A mixture of warm water and a small amount of vinegar can help break down grease.
                                    Apply
                                    it using a cloth, let it sit for a minute, then wipe clean. Always test on a small
                                    hidden spot first to avoid damaging the finish.
                                </p>

                                    Handles, knobs, and edges collect the most dirt because they are touched daily.

                                    Use a clean dry towel to wipe every section after cleaning. For extra shine, buff

                                    Avoid harsh chemicals because they can remove natural shine. Mild soap and warm

                                    are usually enough for safe and effective results.

                                    Laminate cabinets are usually easier to clean because they resist moisture well. You
                                    can
                                    wipe them with soapy water and remove grease more easily compared to wood.

                                    Cleaning Cabinets</h2>

                                    Some cleaning habits can damage cabinets and reduce their life. One mistake is using
                                    harsh cleaners that remove shine or weaken the finish. Another mistake is soaking
                                    cabinets with water, which can cause warping, swelling, or peeling.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                                    Avoid using steel wool or rough pads because they scratch the surface. Also, do not
                                    ignore grease for too long. Old grease becomes thick and much harder to remove
                                    later.

                                    The best schedule depends on your kitchen use. If you cook daily, your cabinets need

                                    the
                                    kitchen looking fresh.

                                    Deep cleaning can be done once every few months. During deep cleaning, focus on
                                    corners, top edges, handles, and inside cabinet shelves. A simple routine keeps
                                    everything neat and easy to maintain.
